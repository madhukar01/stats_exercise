    "- $ Y_{ijk} $ is the response variable for the $ i $-th level of factor A, the $ j $-th level of factor B, and the $ k $-th replicate.\n",
    "- $ \\mu_{ij} $ is the mean effect for the combination of the $ i $-th level of factor A and the $ j $-th level of factor B.\n",
    "- $ \\epsilon_{ijk} $ is the random error associated with the $ i $-th level of factor A, the $ j $-th level of factor B, and the $ k $-th replicate\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "1. Independence: The observations are independent of each other. This means the data collected for one cell does not influence the data collected for another.\n",
    "2. Normality: The random errors $ \\epsilon_{ijk} $ are normally distributed.\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variances of the error terms are constant across all levels of the factors.\n",
    "4. Fixed Effects: In this model, both factors are considered to have fixed effects. This means that the levels of each factor are specifically chosen by the experimenter and are of primary interest.\n",
    "5. No Interactions (in the basic model): This assumption means that the effect of one factor is consistent at all levels of the other factor."
