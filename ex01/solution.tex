\subsubsection*{Key Observation}

\subsubsection*{Normal Distribution - \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Has a narrow curve due to low variance, resulting in a high probability
    density around the mean (0).
    \item It has shorter tails - samples drawn from this distribution will be closer
    to the mean.
    \item Does not have long tails - chances of drawing extreme values are low.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Normal Distribution - \(\mathcal{N}(3, 5)\)}
In comparison with \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\),
\begin{itemize}
    \item Has a wider curve due to high variance, resulting in a lower probability
    density around the mean (3).
    \item It has longer tails - a significant number of samples drawn from this
    distribution can be away from the mean (due to high variance).
    \item Tails are slightly longer than \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\), but chances of
    drawing extreme values are still low.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Cauchy Distribution - \(Cauchy(-2, 2)\)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Has a narrower curve when compared to \(\mathcal{N}(3, 5)\) and has
    longer tails.
    \item This distribution is not symmetric and does not have a mean or variance.
    \item Chances of drawing extreme values are higher when compared to Normal distribution.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 1.c}
\subsubsection*{QQ plot for samples from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\)}
\includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{graph1c}
From the QQ plot,
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can observe that the samples drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\)
closely align with the theoretical quantiles of normal distribution.
    \item They form a straight line, indicating that the samples are normally
    distributed.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Question 1.d}
\subsubsection*{QQ plot for samples from \(\mathcal{N}(3, 5)\)}
\includegraphics*[width=\linewidth]{graph1d}
From the QQ plot,
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can observe that the samples drawn from \(\mathcal{N}(3, 5)\)
closely align with the theoretical quantiles of normal distribution.
    \item We can see a few points away from the straight line in the plot.
    This is because of the high variance in the distribution.
    \item Ignoring a few outliers, the samples are closer to a straight line,
    indicating that the samples are normally distributed.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section*{Question 1.e}
\subsubsection*{QQ plot for samples from \(Cauchy(-2, 2)\)}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graph1e}
From the QQ plot,
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can observe that the samples drawn from \(Cauchy(-2, 2)\) do not form
    a straight line - indicating that the samples are not normally distributed.
    \item In addition, we can see multiple outliers in the plot - indicating a
    longer tail.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Question 2.a}
Given data: \(x_1 - \bar{x}, x_2 - \bar{x}, x_3 - \bar{x} \dots x_9 - \bar{x}\)
and a mean \(\bar{x}\) of 10 data points.
\\[\baselineskip]
Mean is defined as:

\[\bar{x} = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \dots + x_9 + x_{10}) / 10\]
\\
Multiply both sides by 10
\[10 . \bar{x} = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \dots + x_9 + x_{10})\]
\\
Subtract \(9.\bar{x}\) from both sides
\[10. \bar{x} - 9.\bar{x} = (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \dots + x_9 + x_{10}) - 9.\bar{x}\]
\\
Rearrange terms
\[\bar{x} = (x_1 - \bar{x} + x_2 - \bar{x} + x_3 - \bar{x} \dots + x_9 - \bar{x}) + x_{10}\]
\[x_{10} =  (x_1 - \bar{x} + x_2 - \bar{x} + x_3 - \bar{x} \dots + x_9 - \bar{x}) - \bar{x}\]
\\
By substituting the given data points and mean, we get the value of \(x_{10}\).
\\
\section*{Question 2.b}
Sample data points: \(x_1, x_2, x_3 \dots x_9, x_{10}\).
\\
\[s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{i=n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}\]
\\
\(\bar{x}\) is the mean of the sample data points and not the population mean.
\\[\baselineskip]
In this case of sample variance, degrees of freedom is n-1 because we use the
sample mean which is a calculated measure from the sample data.
For n = 10, degrees of freedom is 9.
\\[\baselineskip]
Given \(n-1\) data points and a mean of \(n\) data points, we can easily calculate the
missing data point. Which means only \(n-1\) data points can vary, hence we lose
one degree of freedom.
